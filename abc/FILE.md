  # FILE operations

The module contains various file-related routines.
Creating, opening, removing, memory-mapping files, etc.
Those are mostly ABC wrappers for POSIX routines.

For read-only files, `FILEmap` is highly recommended.
For append-only files, `FILEfeed` and a `Bu8` buffer might work.
Andy Pavlo insists that `FILEmap` is not good for random-access writes.
You may use the `pwrite` wrapper instead.
